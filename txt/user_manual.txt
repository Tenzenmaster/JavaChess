*There are a few differences between KRAZYKHESS and normal chess:
    - No en passant
    - No castling
    - No 50-move rule
    - No promotion, your punishment for not winning in the middlegame endgame is a draw >:)
    - Moving into check is legal so be careful!
    - Capture the enemy king to deliver checkmate
    - This also means stalemate will result in a win under best play
